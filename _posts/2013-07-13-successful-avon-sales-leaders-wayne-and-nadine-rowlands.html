<h4>When did you join Avon?</h4>
<p>We joined Avon as Sales Leaders in August 2005 around our 'then' full-time jobs.</p>
<br/>

<h4>What did you do before becoming an Avon representative?</h4>
<p>Wayne worked as an Engineer and I (Nadine) was a Legal Secretary.</p>  
<br/>

<h4>Why did you decide to join Avon?</h4>
<p>We started Avon because we desperately needed to earn some extra money!</p>
<br>

<h4>When were you able to take the plunge into doing Avon full time?</h4>
<p>After 3 years Wayne left his full-time job and 2 years later I (Nadine) left my full-time job. Since January 2011 we have worked together building our AVON business and helping our team of representatives and sales leaders to grow their AVON businesses too.</p>
<br/>

<h4>What level are you both at?</h4>
<p>We are both currently at Senior Executive level</p>  
<br/>

<h4>In addition to your commission, what prizes and incentives have you qualified for and won?</h4>
<br/>
<ul>
<li class = "one">We have qualified for trips to Prague, Majorca, Monte Carlo, Berlin, Malta and Rome</li>
<li class = "two">In 2011, our team was awarded Avon's Outstanding Achievement Award of the Year</li>
<li class = "three">In 2012 we qualified for Avon's "Drive Your Dream" Incentive and came away with an Astra GTC</li>
<li class = "four">in 2012, the day after we qualified for the above car, absolutely by chance Wayne actually won, in a prize draw, a fantastic Audi A1 !</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<h4>What cars do you currently drive?</h4>
<p>Thanks to Avon, our everyday is the GTC which we qualified for and our "play" car is a Jaguar XK. Check out our custom registration plates!</p>
