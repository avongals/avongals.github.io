<p>If you've been following the business news, you might know that Avon recently found a new CEO to replace the 13 year veteran CEO Andrea Chung. This new CEO Sheri McCoy has already made some big changes, so this is a more exciting time than ever to become an Avon representative!</p> 
<br/>

<br/>
<p>This quote from Sheri sums up her vision for me:</p>
<blockquote>"I quickly learned that we need to get our organization focused on making sure <b>[the representative is]</b> successful. When she's successful, we'e successful. The company was going through a lot of change, and there had been ups and downs, so the organization was very internally focused. My agenda was to get people more focused on the external world: What's important for our representatives? How can we give her a competitive earnings opportunity? How can we make it easy for her to do business with us? How do we continue to make sure our brand is relevant with the consumer base?"</blockquote>

<p>So what changes have we noticed as a UK Avon representative?</p>
<ul>
	<li class = "one">Avon seem to be getting stricter on who they accept - this can only be a good thing in my opinion. By reducing debt leads, Avon should have more profit to spend on their business.</li>
	<li class = "two">More TV adverts - I guess there must be a huge drive to find new representatives and promote awareness, since we've noticed Avon appearing on the television a lot more.</li>
</ul>
