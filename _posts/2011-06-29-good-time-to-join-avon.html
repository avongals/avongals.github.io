<p>If you've been following the business news, you might know that Avon has recently found a new CEO to replace the 13 year veteran CEO Andrea Chung. This new CEO Sheri McCoy has already made some big changes, so this is a more exciting time than ever to become an Avon representative!</p>

	<div class="span8">
		<p>This one quote from Sheri really sums it up for me:</p>
		<p><em>"I quickly learned that we need to get our organization focused on making sure [the representative is] successful. When she's successful, we'e successful. The company was going through a lot of change, and there had been ups and downs, so the organization was very internally focused. My agenda was to get people more focused on the external world: What's important for our representatives? How can we give her a competitive earnings opportunity? How can we make it easy for her to do business with us? How do we continue to make sure our brand is relevant with the consumer base?"</em></p>

<p>So what changes have we noticed as a UK Avon representative?</p>
<ul>
	<li>Avon appear to be getting tighter on who they will appoint - this can only be a good thing in my opinion. By reducing debt leads, Avon have more profits to spend on their business.</li>
