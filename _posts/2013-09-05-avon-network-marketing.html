<p>If you ask most people what Avon is about, they will probably recall the vintage <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdMTlwtQObE">"Avon lady"</a> image of selling makeup and beauty products to friends and neighbours. Of course they're not wrong, those direct-selling Avon representatives are still the lifeblood of Avon's business.</p>
<p>What many people don't know is that Avon operates a fairly unique business model, that has survived (and thrived) during many economic downturns.</p>
<p>Avon's business model falls into the category of 'network marketing', otherwise known as 'multi-level-marketing'. This means that, rather than Avon's employees recruiting new Avon representatives, it is existing Avon representatives who do the recruiting themselves, using tools and guidelines provided by Avon.</p>
<p>People who do this are known as 'sales leaders' and earn commission on their team's sales as well as their own. As a result of this, the earning opportunities as an Avon sales leader vastly surpass the earning oppportunities as an Avon representative. There are now numerous "Avon millionaires" who have grown rich by becoming <a href="/2013/07/13/successful-avon-sales-leaders-wayne-and-nadine-rowlands.html" target="_blank">successful Avon sales leaders.</a> The best way to imagine this commission-earning hierarchy is to think of a pyramid.</p>
<br/>
<div style="width:100%; font-size:80%; text-align:center;"><img src="/assets/img/blog/pyramid-one.jpg" class="img-rounded" alt="Avon multi level marketing" width="width" height="height" style="padding-bottom:0.5em;" />Sales leaders earn commission on their team</div>
<br/>
<p>As a sales leader, you will earn commission on several levels (or generations) below you, meaning that the amount of commission you earn is proportional to your team's earnings, not just your own. As your team thrives, so do you.</p>
<div class="well well-small">
<p><b>For example:</b> If one of your sales leaders signs up a new representative, you will earn commission on both your sales leader's income, and their new representative's income.</p>
</div>
<p>Although sales leadership offers much bigger earning potential, being an Avon sales leader can be very hard work at times. Team retention is important as representatives are always leaving, so you must always be building your front line team</p> 
<br/>
<h5>Currently the commission rates are as follows:</h5>

<div class="well well-small">
 <table class = "table table-striped">
	<thead>
		<td></td>
		<td>1st generation</td>
		<td>2nd generation</td>
		<td>3rd generation</td>
	</thead>
		
	<tr>
		<td>Sales leader</td>
		<td>2-5%</td>
		<td>2%</td>
		<td>-</td>
	</tr>
	
	<tr>
		<td>Advanced sales leader</td>
		<td>3-7%</td>
		<td>2%</td>
		<td>2%</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Executive sales leader</td>
		<td>4-10%</td>
		<td>2-4%</td>
		<td>2%</td>
	</tr>
		<tr>
		<td>Senior executive sales leader</td>
		<td>4-12%</td>
		<td>3-5%</td>
		<td>2%</td>
	</tr>		
 </table>
</div>
 
<p>As you rise up the ranks of sales leadership, your job becomes more about motivating and helping your sales leaders and providing leads. Although you still need to meet your own personal sales targets as well, everyone in Avon is a seller! The most successful sales leaders become experts in finding and distributing leads to their team.</p>
<p>Many senior executive sales leaders advertise for leads using services such as Google Adwords (just try doing a search for Avon in Google and you will see lots of paid-for adverts appear). They then sell these leads to their team.</p>

<h5>To become an Avon representative or sales leader</h5>

<li>Fill out the form on the right hand side.</li>
<li>Wait for someone from my team to contact you (this should be less than 24 hours)</li>
</ul>

<div class="well well-small"><b>One final note</b> - I've used a pyramid above to describe the commission structure, however Avon Cosmetics is not what is commonly known as a "pyramid scheme".<em> A <a href = "http://www.wikihow.com/Distinguish-Between-a-Pyramid-Scheme-and-Multi-Level-Marketing">pyramid scheme</a> involves the exchange of money but has no product or service. With Avon everyone sells Avon products, from representatives at the bottom to Senior Executive Sales Leaders at the very top!</div>
