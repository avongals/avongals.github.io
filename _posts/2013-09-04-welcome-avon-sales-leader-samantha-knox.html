<h4>Welcome Samantha!</h4>
<img>
<p>We would like to welcome new trainee sales leader, Samantha Knox to our team. Samantha has been an Avon customer herself for a number of years. She decided to join Avon 6 weeks ago and now wants to make money with the network-marketing side of Avon, by recruiting a team of her own.</p>
<p>Samantha decided to take the plunge into sales leadership last week and she has already reached her target to become an Avon sales leader, with 7 people in her team. The minimum target is 5, which means she should qualify for Avon's <b>&pound;50 bonus</b> for reaching sales leader status in her first 3 campaigns, fingers crossed and well done Samantha!</p>

<p>What I like about Samantha is that she is a real self-starter, full of enthusiasm, drive and confidence. I know she'll do great! Here's what Samantha had to say about her first campaign and personal motivations:</p>
<div class="well well-small">
<h5>What do you think about your first campaign as a trainee sales leader?</h5>
<em>"Am absolutely over the moon I've got my 5 representatives, all in my first campaign as well! But really once again I've got to give my amazing sales-leader Ashleigh that's giving me all the time, support, training but most of all her patience all the credit for me achieving this, as without her help I don't think I would have qualified until next Christmas! :-D"</em>
</div>
<div class="well well-small">
<h5>What is your first goal?</h5>
<p><em>"I'm going to be relying on the money I earn to start decorating my flat, bit by bit"</em></p>
</div>
<div class="well well-small">
<h5>Which areas can you cover?</h5>
<p><em>"I can cover most areas of Newcastle and Gateshead"</em><p>
