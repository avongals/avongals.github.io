<p>Newcastle Upon Tyne is a great place to become an Avon representative. The people are renowned for being warm and friendly and the Avon Cosmetics brand is well known across the region. When we're out canvassing our local streets, we often hear comments along the lines of <em>"Yes, our Katie used to do that, I'd love a book!"</em></p>
<p>My partner and I live in the neighbouring town of Gateshead, so if you want to join Avon in Newcastle we can sign you up very quickly. On the other hand, if it turns out you're too far out of our way, we have Avon sales leaders all across the North East who can visit you instead.</p>
<h4>Some facts about Avon and Newcastle</h4>
<div class="well well-small">
<ul>
<li>There are approximately 24 distinct 'areas' in the North East*
<li>Each area has between 250-400 representatives*</li>
<li>The most successful Avon Sales Leaders in the entire UK are <a href = "http://www.avonconnects.co.uk/view-prp.jspa?username=debbiecarter"> Debbie & Dave Carter</a>, from the nearby town of Sunderland</li>
<li>They're not the only success stories. There are other inspirational people in the North East, such as <a href = "http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/consett-womans-career-change-leads-4017007">Avon Sales Leader Marsha Barras</a> from nearby Consett
</ul>

<p>We find that most areas are not completely saturated with Avon representatives, so customers are generally pretty easy to come by. According to Newcastle Council, there are around <a href = "http://www.newcastle.gov.uk/your-council/statistics-and-census-information/population-current">140,600 women in Newcastle</a> - that's plenty of potential customers!</p>
<p>One of the main advantages of becoming an Avon representative in our immediate area is that we are close by to help. We can devote a significant amount of time to nearby team members, as well as contributing our own local knowledge and experiences, such as the best places to canvass, local events and who to contact when you get stuck.</p> 
<p>Most people starting with Avon find they need a little extra support in the very beginning. For example, you might need us to pop around and deliver you a few more brochures, help with your first makeup return, or visit for a second appointment. So being geographically close to us gives you a great advantage!</p>
