<p>Selling Avon door-to-door is a great way to widen your customer base. This comes naturally to some people, but if you're not one of those people don't worry, there's hope for you yet! Here are two different methods of door-to-door prospecting. The method you choose will depend on how confident you are:</p>

				<h4>Method 1 - for confident people</h4> 
					<ul>
						<li class="star">Knock and introduce yourself</li>
						<li class="star">Ask if you can leave a brochure</li>
						<li class="star">Knock and collect a few days later</li>
					</ul>
				<em>This method lets you introduce yourself to your potential customers straight away, but can be a little bit intimidating if you're a shy person. It also means you don't waste brochures!</em>

				<h4>Method 2 - for shy people</h4>
					<ul>
						<li class="star">Post the brochure</li>
						<li class="star">Knock and collect a few days later</li>
					</ul>
				<em>This is more of a scattergun-type approach, but is probably better for shy people. Knocking and asking to collect a brochure is easier than knocking and asking if somebody wants one!</em>

<h4>Some other useful tips:</h4>
<br/>
<ul>
<li><b>Play the Numbers Game</b> - Set some goals for yourself and canvass a number of new houses each campaign. I make sure I set aside a certain amount of time in my diary purely for door-to-door prospecting every campaign.</li>
<li><b>Stay Positive</b> - Prospective customers wil pick up on any negativity you have. So go prospecting with a positive attitude and a smile on your face.</li>
<li><b>Be Confident</b> - Be confident. If you feel like you shouldn't be on someone's doorstep, your prospect will smell it from a mile away. Selling is the foundation of our economy!</li>
<li><b>Dont Try to Sell at the Door</b> - Your main goal is to get your Avon brochure into the right person's hands. After that, the brochure should sell itself.</li>
<li><b>Be Organised</b> - Go back when you say you will. Keep meticulous records of interested prospects and houses which aren't interested.</li>
