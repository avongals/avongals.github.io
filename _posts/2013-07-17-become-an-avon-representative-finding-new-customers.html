<p>There is no secret to making money with Avon, but one thing is for sure....the more customers you have, the more money you will make. Here is my ultimate list of ways to get more customers:</p>
<br/>
<ul>
<li class="party"><b>Hold an Avon Party</b> - Ask your area manager for a party kit, then invite your regular customers and their friends.</li>
<br/>
<li class="friend"><b>Add Extra order forms 'for a friend'</b> -  Put extra order forms in your catalogue and mark these 'for a friend'</li>
<br/>
<li class="window"><b>Put a note in your post office window</b> - Leave a note that says <em>"Have you lost your Avon representative? Contact me today"</em></li>
<br/>
<li class="pob"><b>Post your Personal Online Brochure (POB) online</b> - Post a link to your POB on Facebook, Twitter or Google+ for everyone to see!</li>
<br/>
<li class="territory"><b>Canvass your local territory</b> - The most successful Avon representatives canvass their local territory to find new customers.</li> 
<br/>
<li class="work"><b>Take a book into work</b> -  Your office can be an excellent place to get regular orders. New customers can be anyone from cleaning staff to receptionists </li> 
<br/>
<li class="workpartner"><b>Ask your partner to take a book into work</b> - Your significant other might get some stick from their workmates, but if they love you, they shouldn't complain ;-)</li>
<br/>
<li class="giveaway"><b>Offer a free giveaway</b> - A free giveaway is an excellent way to get potential customers interested in Avon.</li>
<br/>

<br/>
<li class="flyers"><b>Advertise with flyers</b> - Print off some cheap flyers to let people know there is a new Avon representative in their area.</li> 
<br/>
<li class="businesses"><b>Approach local businesses</b> - team up with local hairdressers or beauty salons to find new customers</li>
<br/>
<li class="facebook"><b>Create an Avon Facebook group</b> - start by inviting existing customers, then post any interesting Avon updates.</li>
<br/>
<li class="incentives"><b>Incentivise customer referrals</b> - Offer your customers a free product or discount off their next order when they refer a friend.</li>
<br/>
<li class="list"><b>Make a 'who do you know' list</b> - Go through your phone or Facebook and make a list of possible customers.</li>
</ul>
