<p>When you become an Avon representative, there is a small joining fee of &pound;15. Everyone has to pay this and it just covers your start up costs with Avon, which includes:</p>
<br/>
<div class="well well-small">
<ul>
<li class="pig-grey">Startup brochures (usually for your first few campaigns)</li>
<li class="pig-grey">Admin costs</li>
<li class="pig-grey">Startup literature</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>The good news is that this is the only fee you pay, and the cost is spread out over your first and second campaigns. Spreading the cost like this means that you should still make some profit when you first start!</p>

<br/>
<h4>Here's an example of how the start-up cost might affect you:</h4>

<div class="well well-small">
<h5>First campaign:</h5>
<p>+ &pound;200 - Total orders<br/>
<b>-</b> &pound;150 - Cost of products (with 25% discount)<br/>
<b>-</b> &pound;7.50 - First admin fee installment<br/>
---------------------------------------------
<br/>
<em><b>=</b> &pound;42.50 - Total profit<br/></em>
---------------------------------------------
</p>
</div>

<div class="well well-small">
<h5>Second campaign:</h5>
<p>+ &pound;200 - Total orders<br/>
<b>-</b> &pound;150 - Cost of products (with 25% discount)<br/>
<b>-</b> &pound;7.50 - Second admin fee installment<br/>
---------------------------------------------
<br/>
<em><b>=</b> &pound;42.50 - Total profit<br/></em>
---------------------------------------------
</p>
</div>

<br/>
<h4>What happens if you decide Avon isn't for you?</h4>
<p>If you quit before your first campaign - you won't pay any admin fee.<br/>
If you quit before your second campaign - you will only pay half the admin fee</p>

<br/>

<h4>What happens if you don't place orders for a while?</h4>
<p>If you don't place orders for 3 consecutive campaigns (that's 3 campaigns in a row), Avon will automatically remove you. If you then decide you want to put orders in, Avon will recharge you the admin fee, so be warned! That's at least 9 weeks of not placing orders though, so you should have plenty of notice</p>

<br/>
<h4>How does Avon's startup cost compare to other direct-selling companies?</h4>
<p>Ann Summers - &pound;112<br/>
Jamie at Home -  &pound;100<br/>
Kleeneze - &pound;75 / &pound;135</p>

<p>As you can see, Avon requires much less investment!</p>

<p>The startup costs are lower than other Direct Selling companies because you buy products on credit, rather than buying products out of your own money. Since the &pound;15 admin fee comes out of your profits, most people don't even notice it.</p>
