<p>If you want to find new Avon customers in your area, then I would highly recommend that you register on Avon's website for automatic leads. This is an easy way to find new customers WITHOUT having to do any prospecting yourself.</p>
<p>These people have browsed to the Avon website to find a representative in their area, so you know they are keen to become a customer. In our experience these leads can become excellent customers, although we personally find that the orders are more likely to be 'one-off' but with a higher order value than our regular customer orders. Typically we get around 1 new lead per campaign</p>
<p>Avon does not automatically register you for automatic leads, but your sales leader might have done this for you.</p>
<br/>
