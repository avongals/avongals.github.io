<p>If you decide to run a loyalty scheme for your customers, it's important to think carefully about the value of the gifts you give away.</p>
<p>The official Avon loyalty cards recommend that your customers order from you six times, with a minimum spend of &pound;10, before they get a free gift. You might decide to do something totally different, but we think the Avon loyalty scheme is a great place to start.</p>
<p>So how does a loyalty scheme cut into your profit margin? Well, firstly lets look at how much profit you will make from your 6 minimum customer orders:

 <div class="row-fluid">
        <div class="span12">
		  <table class = "table table-striped">
			<thead>
				<td>Order</td>
				<td>Value</td>
				<td>Profit (at 20% target)</td>
				<td>Profit (at 25% target)</td>
			</thead>
			<tr>
				<td>1</td>
				<td>&pound;10</td>
				<td>&pound;2</td>
				<td>&pound;2.5</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>2</td>
				<td>&pound;10</td>
				<td>&pound;2</td>
				<td>&pound;2.5</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>3</td>
				<td>&pound;10</td>
				<td>&pound;2</td>
				<td>&pound;2.5</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>4</td>
				<td>&pound;10</td>
				<td>&pound;2</td>
				<td>&pound;2.5</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>5</td>
				<td>&pound;10</td>
				<td>&pound;2</td>
				<td>&pound;2.5</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>6</td>
				<td>&pound;10</td>
				<td>&pound;2</td>
				<td>&pound;2.5</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>TOTAL</td>
				<td>&pound;60</td>
				<td>&pound;12</td>
				<td>&pound;15</td>
			</tr>
			
		  </table>
		</div>
</div>

<h3>Worst case scenario</h3>
<p>In a worst case scenario situation, your customers spend the very minimum amount every campaign to qualify for the free gift AND you only hit the low commission targets</p>

 <div class="row-fluid">
        <div class="span12">
		  <table class = "table table-striped">
			<thead>
				<td>Free gift - cost to you</td>
				<td>Free gift - catalogue price</td>
				<td>Lost profit (&pound;'s)</td>
				<td>Lost profit (as % of profit)</td>
			</thead>
			<tr>
				<td>1</td>
				<td>&pound;10</td>
				<td>&pound;2</td>
				<td>&pound;2.5</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>2</td>
				<td>&pound;10</td>
				<td>&pound;2</td>
				<td>&pound;2.5</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>3</td>
				<td>&pound;10</td>
				<td>&pound;2</td>
				<td>&pound;2.5</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>4</td>
				<td>&pound;10</td>
				<td>&pound;2</td>
				<td>&pound;2.5</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>5</td>
				<td>&pound;10</td>
				<td>&pound;2</td>
				<td>&pound;2.5</td>

			<tr>
				<td>6</td>
				<td>&pound;10</td>
				<td>&pound;2</td>
				<td>&pound;2.5</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>TOTAL</td>
				<td>&pound;60</td>
				<td>&pound;12</td>
				<td>&pound;15</td>
			</tr>
