<p>The AVON business model means that, in order to reach (and maintain) the various sales leader levels, you need to have a <b>[minimum number] </b>of sales leaders underneath you. With sales leaders in your team being so important, how much should you encourage regular AVON representatives to become sales leaders?</p>
<p>We recently went to an interesting talk by Dave Carter who gave his opinion. To give you some background, Dave and his partner Debbie earned &pound;250,000 last year as Senior Executive Sales Leaders. Together they are the most successful AVON team in the UK. Daves answer? Don't push sales leadership at all!</p>

<p>So what is the reason behind this backwards-sounding logic? Well when Dave first started, he would always mention sales leadership in every appointment. Soon though, he realised that this was counter-productive and pushing sales leadership in appointments was a waste of time.</p>
<p>Daves advice to other sales leaders like us was to simply concentrate on signing up representatives. For every 100 regular appointments, he said, a good sales leader should naturally emerge. As Dave explained, there is no "trick" to success with AVON. It is simply a numbers game. It seems there really is is no substitute for hard work! Thanks for the advice Dave.</p>
