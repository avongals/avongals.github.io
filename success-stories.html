<h2>Our Team</h2>
<p>Here are some of our team, who have enjoyed great success with AVON. The most hardworking have been able to quite their full time jobs and fulfil their life's ambitions; others have simply been able to enjoy extra income towards everyday living cost or luxuries.</p>

			 <h4>Wayne and Nadine Rowlands</h4>
			 <h5>Senior Executive Sales Leaders</h5>
			 <p>Nadine and Wayne Rowlands joined AVON as Sales Leaders in August 2005, working around their full-time jobs.  Wayne worked as an Engineer and Nadine was a Legal Secretary.  They started AVON because they desperately needed to earn some extra money...and so their AVON journey began.</p>
			 <p>After 3 years Wayne left his full-time job and 2 years later Nadine left her full-time job and since January 2011 they have worked together building their AVON business and team of representatives</p>
			 <p>They are both currently at Senior Executive level and regularly qualify for incentives which AVON run, including trips to Prague, Majorca, Monte Carlo, Berlin, Malta and Rome.</p>

			<h4>Vilina Teasdale</h4>
			<h5>Advanced Sales Leader</h5>
			<p>Vilina decided to start AVON when she couldn't find work as a teacher. She wanted to make extra money for herself and her family and soon became a successful AVON Sales Leader.</p>
			<p>Her first goal was to save enough money to go on a trip to New York. Last year, she fullfilled her dream and went on a two week holiday there. Now she is saving for her next life goal!

			<h4>Ashleigh and Paul <small> (that's us!) </small></h4>
			<h5>Sales Leaders</h5>
			<p>We couldn't talk about success stories without mentioning ourselves. We started selling and recruiting for AVON to save for our wedding. In a short space of time we have built one of the fastest growing teams in the North East. There's no stopping us now.</p>
			<p>As AVON sales leaders we get to meet lots of great people every day. What's more, we get to spend lots of time together, working towards our shared dream!</p>
