<p>When you first become an Avon representative, there are lots of incentives to keep you motivated and reward you for placing your first six orders. These are known as Smartstart Incentives.</p>
<p>To qualify for the Smartstart Incentives, you must meet or exceed the Minimum Order Values or Higher Order Values for each campaign, as shown in the image below. Remember that the Minimum Order Value (MOV) is <b>&pound;80</b> and the Higher Order Value (HOV) is <b>&pound;150.</b></p>

<p>When you join Avon in our team, we advise not to waste money on samples. Of course makeup and perfume samples are a great way of increasing your sales, but as long as you hit your Smartstart targets, you should get plenty of samples for free!</p>
<p>These free samples last a long time, when used sparingly.</p>
<p>The Smartstart Incentives are as follows:</p>
