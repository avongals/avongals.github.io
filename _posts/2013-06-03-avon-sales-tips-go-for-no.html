<p>The number one tip for success with Avon (like any direct selling company) is to <b>tell everyone you're selling AVON!</b> 

<p>When we say everyone, we mean everyone. If you want to see your sales improve, then you should prepared to venture outside of your comfort zone a little. Before long, you'll find that your confidence is brimming and speaking to complete strangers about AVON is perfectly within your comfort zone. Sounds great doesn't it?</p>
<p>If you're already wondering what people will say to you, that's only natural. Most people are scared of rejection when they first start, but believe me when I say this....the reactions you get from people are NEVER as bad as you imagine! The worst thing that might happen is that they say no! </p>
<p>In fact, that's exactly what you should be aiming for. The best attitude to have with AVON is "GO for NO!" If you're not getting any "no's" then you're not trying hard enough ;-)</p>
<p>If you need still some motivation, I highly recommend you watch this great video!</p>
