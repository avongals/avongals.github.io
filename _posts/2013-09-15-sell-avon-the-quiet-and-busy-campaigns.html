<h3>Selling Avon during the seasonal campaigns</h3>
<p>Like most direct-selling businesses, Avon Cosmetics (and your ability to sell the products) is affected by the seasons. There are busy selling campaigns and quiet ones; after a while you get to know which campaigns are the best.</p>

<h3>The busy Avon campaigns</h3>
<p>According to Deborah Gibson, manager of area 763, the busiest time of the year is during the run up to Christmas, starting around September. You should see your sales grow the most in campaigns <b>16, 17</b> and <b>18</b>, which means that we're just starting the busy campaigns right now. Time to really get selling!</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4>Sales representatives:</h4>
<p>The fruits of your labour can be much greater around this time of year, so make sure everyone you know gets an Avon book. You might want to offer extra incentives if your existing customers refer friends and family.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Sales leaders:</h4>
<p>This is a good time for recruiting new representatives. Lots of people join to earn discounts on Christmas presents for friends and family. Others just want earn a little extra income to buy presents.</p>

</ul>

<h3>The quiet Avon campaigns</h3>
<p>In my experience the quietest campaigns are campaigns <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> just after Christmas. Many people are on a tighter budget around this time of year and have received beauty products as Christmas presents, so it can be a tough time to sell certain products.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4>Sales representatives:</h4>
<p>Do your best to brave the cold and make sure your Avon customers still get a book. It's easy to get disheartened around this time and end up leaving, but remember that Avon usually run some great January sale offers to encourage sales. Some representatives even give out two books at a time, to try and encourage orders during the shorter campaigns</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Sales leaders:</h4>
<p>Be prepared for the fact that a large amount of representatives will inevitably leave shortly after the Christmas period. According to our upline, it is normal to lose between 25% to 50% of your team, which can be quite disheartening if you're not prepared for it!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>(Note: Avon will be bringing in some new <a href="/2013/09/14/incentives-for-campaigns-1-to-3.html" target="_blank">incentives for campaigns 1 to 3</a> of 2014 to encourage reps to stick things out through the tough winter campaigns)</p>

<p>If you understand when the busy and quiet periods are, you should be able to use this knowledge to your advantage to improve your personal sales.</p>
