<p>

There are lots of advantages in selling Avon with your partner. As a representative, there are times when having an extra set of hands can be really useful. As a sales leader, having your partner in your team helps you hit Avon's sales leader targets and has big financial advantages.</p>

<h3>For representatives</h3>

<ul>

<li><b>Extra moral support</b> - A little extra support can stop you getting demoralised and losing focus, especially at the start when things are a little tough.</li>
<li><b>Another 'set of hands'</b> - There will always be times when your customers need their order but you have other commitments. If your partner wants to</li>
<li><b>Help on delivery day</b> - With one person calling out orders and the other person packing them into bags, delivery day is a lot less hastle!</li>

</ul>
