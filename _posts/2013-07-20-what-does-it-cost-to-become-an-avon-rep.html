<p>When you become an Avon representative, there is a small joining fee of &pound;15. This applies to everybody and covers your start up costs with Avon, including:</p>
<br/>
<ul>
<li class="pig">Startup Avon brochures (usually for your first few campaigns)</li>
<li class="pig">Admin costs</li>
<li class="pig">Startup literature</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<p>The good thing is that this is the only fee you pay, and it is spread over your 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> campaigns. Spreading the cost like this means that you generally make some profit when you first start!</p>

<br/>
<h4>Here's an example:</h4>

<div class="well well-small">
<b>First campaign:</b>
<p>&pound;200 - Total Orders<br/>
<b>-</b> &pound;150 - Cost of products (with 25% discount)<br/>
<b>-</b> &pound;7.50 - First admin fee<br/>
<em><b>=</b> &pound;42.50 - Profit<br/></em>
</p>
</div>

<div class="well well-small">
<b>Second campaign:</b>
<p>&pound;200 - Total Orders<br/>
<b>-</b> &pound;150 - Cost of products (with 25% discount)<br/>
<b>-</b> &pound;7.50 - Second admin fee<br/>
<em><b>=</b> &pound;42.50 - Profit<br/></em>
</p>
</div>

<br/>

<h4>What happens if you decide Avon isn't for you?</h4>
<p>If you quit before your first campaign - you won't pay any admin fee.<br/>
If you quit before your second campaign - you will only pay half the admin fee</p>

<br/>
<h4>How does this compare to other direct selling companies?</h4>
<p>Ann Summers - &pound;112<br/>
Jamie at Home -  &pound;100<br/>
Kleeneze - &pound;75 / &pound;135</p>

<p>As you can see, Avon requires much less investment!</p>

<p>The startup costs are lower than other Direct Selling companies because you buy products on credit, rather than buying products out of your own money. Since the &pound;15 admin fee comes out of your profits, most people don't even notice it.</p>
