<p>Everyone learns from their mistakes, but luckily for you I've made most of them, so that you can learn from mine! For a lot of people, Avon is their first business venture, so it's easy to get caught up in the excitement and forget the most important thing. You are doing Avon to make money!</p>
<h3>Here are 5 mistakes you are likely to make when you first join Avon:</h3>
<hr/>
<h4>1) - Ordering too many brochures</h4>

<div class="row-fluid">

	<div class="span4">
		<div style="width:180px; font-size:80%; text-align:center;"><img src="/assets/img/blog/brochure-stack.jpg" class="img-rounded" alt="Order too many Avon brochures" width="width" height="height" style="padding-bottom:0.5em;" />Try to order 'just enough' brochures</div>
	</div>

	<div class="span8">
	<blockquote>
		<p>Don't get wrapped up in thinking <em>"If I have X brochures, I can get Y customers".</em> Building customers takes time and unless you're a determined salesman/woman it's probably best to let your sales drive your brochure ordering, not the other way around. Every surplus brochure you order eats into your profit margin and besides, you can always re-use brochures!</p>

<h4>2) - Neglecting existing customers by looking for new ones</h4>

<div class="row-fluid">

	<div class="span4">
		<div style="width:180px; font-size:80%; text-align:center;"><img src="/assets/img/blog/ash-door.jpg" class="img-rounded" alt="Order too many Avon brochures" width="width" height="height" style="padding-bottom:0.5em;" />Most of your income comes from regular customers</div>
	</div>

	<div class="span8">
	<blockquote>
		<p>
		Like any business, your existing customers are your best source of income. Remember that you've spent time and money finding them and building a relationship with them. Make a list of your regular customers and make sure they get a brochure every campaign. Here are some <a href="/2013/06/03/selling-avon-keep-customers-buying.html" target="_blank"> tips for keeping your customers happy</a>

<h4>3) - Forgetting how you 'get paid' with Avon</h4>

<div class="row-fluid">

	<div class="span4">
		<div style="width:180px; font-size:80%; text-align:center;"><img src="/assets/img/blog/piggy.jpg" class="img-rounded" alt="Learn the Avon selling process" width="width" height="height" style="padding-bottom:0.5em;" />Learn the Avon selling process</div>
	</div>

	<div class="span8">
	<blockquote>
		<p>
		It can be easy to accidentally spend your Avon income if you're not careful. Remember that the money you make is the profit left over <b>AFTER YOU PAY YOUR AVON BILL!</b> If you're still not sure how the selling process works, read my blog on <a href="/2013/06/10/Make-money-with-avon-how-you-get-paid.html" target="_blank"> the Avon selling process</a>

</div>

<h4>4) - Buying things you don't need</h4>

<div class="row-fluid">

	<div class="span4">
		<div style="width:180px; font-size:80%; text-align:center;"><img src="/assets/img/blog/calculator.jpg" class="img-rounded" alt="Stick to the business essentials" width="width" height="height" style="padding-bottom:0.5em;" />Just stick to the essentials</div>
	</div>

	<div class="span8">
	<blockquote>
		<p>
		There's very little that you need to be successful with Avon. All you really need is:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Brochures</li>
			<li>Order forms</li>
			<li>Paper bags / delivery bags</li>
			<li>Lots of enthusiasm!</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Avon will try to sell you lots of 'business tools' but everything other than the above is just a luxury!</p>

<h4>5 - Becoming Avon's best customer</h4>

<div class="row-fluid">

	<div class="span4">
		<div style="width:180px; font-size:80%; text-align:center;"><img src="/assets/img/blog/lipstick.jpg" class="img-rounded" alt="Don't get sucked into becoming Avon's best customer" width="width" height="height" style="padding-bottom:0.5em;" />Don't get sucked into becoming Avon's best customer</div>
	</div>

	<div class="span8">
	<blockquote>
		<p>
		Let's face it, Avon has a clever business model. Since you need to reach targets of &pound;80 or &pound;150 to earn commission, it's often tempting to buy things for yourself. Unless your main goal with Avon is to get free lipstick, makeup and perfume, try to steer clear of the tempting deals when you put your order in!</p>
