<p>If you decide to run a loyalty scheme for your customers, it's important to think carefully about the value of the gifts you give away. Remember, you're doing Avon to make money!</p>
<p>The official Avon loyalty cards suggest that your customers should order from you 6 times, with a minimum spend of &pound;10, before they get a free gift. So how does this type of loyalty scheme cut into your profit margin? How much free lipstick, eyeliner or mascara should you be giving away? Well, firstly let's look at how much profit you would make from 6 customer orders:</p>

 <div class="row-fluid">
 
        <div class="span6">
		  <table class = "table table-striped">
			<thead>
				<td>Order number</td>
				<td>Value</td>
				<td>Profit (at 20% target)</td>
				<td>Profit (at 25% target)</td>
			</thead>
			<tr>
				<td>1</td>
				<td>&pound;10</td>
				<td>&pound;2</td>
				<td>&pound;2.5</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>2</td>
				<td>&pound;10</td>
				<td>&pound;2</td>
				<td>&pound;2.5</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>3</td>
				<td>&pound;10</td>
				<td>&pound;2</td>
				<td>&pound;2.5</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>4</td>
				<td>&pound;10</td>
				<td>&pound;2</td>
				<td>&pound;2.5</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>5</td>
				<td>&pound;10</td>
				<td>&pound;2</td>
				<td>&pound;2.5</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>6</td>
				<td>&pound;10</td>
				<td>&pound;2</td>
				<td>&pound;2.5</td>
			</tr>
			<tr class="info">
				<td>TOTAL</td>
				<td>&pound;60</td>
				<td>&pound;12</td>
				<td>&pound;15</td>
			</tr>
			
		  </table>

<p>If your customers have been extremely frugal, then you would have made just &pound;12 from their orders (although this is very unlikely). That should be the absolute maximum you should spend on a free gift. </p>
<br/>
<h2>Some tips from us</h2>
<br/>
<ul>
<li class="one">20% of the total order value is probably a good benchmark to aim for. This means you will still make a good profit.</li>
<li class="two">The "cost" of a free gift to you will be the discounted price, not the catalogue price.</li>
<li class="three">You can afford to give away more expensive gifts for higher orders.</li>
</ul>
